Tic Tac Toe 3D
==============

An old project from college.

Lisp
----

The original version from my AI class.  Run the shell script with clisp.  It will compile the source files, run the program, then delete the compiled files when complete.  It runs the greedy min-max algorithm by default.  To run the normal, slower, but more complete, version of min-max, modify 3dttt.lsp and change (3DTicTacToe) at the bottom to (3DTicTacToe 1).

CPP
---

The Lisp version re-written in C++.

CPP Greedy
----------

The C++ version with the greedy algorithm.

Compiled
--------

Old compiled versions for Windows and Linux.  Not sure how well they work.
